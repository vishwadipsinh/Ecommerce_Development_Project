# Ecommerce_Development_Project
 I developed an eCommerce project using Bootstrap for responsive design and JavaScript for functionality. The application utilizes local storage for data management, enabling users to perform basic operations like adding, updating, and removing items from a shopping cart. The project showcases a clean interface and user-friendly experience.
